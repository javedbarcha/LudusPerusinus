Tileable Building Parts
 -Recommend to set Edit>Snap setting > move X,Y,Z to "0.5"
I design building part base on 3x3 meter, in my opinion set snap move to 0.5,
then hold ctrl while drag and fine tune later is easier to place build part.


Tileable Building Presets
 -Extract "PresetBuildings&BlenderFile.zip" to the same folder.
This preset use materials from main materials folder on the package,
but I use mesh model from blender file then notice later that asset store require fbx format.
(i took half month for doing the preset already,
and i want to do new thing instead of doing same thing again by using another half month :P)



i'm new to the game modeling, and this is my first asset.
any advise, contract
